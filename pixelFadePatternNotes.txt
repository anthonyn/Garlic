ONIONS AND GARLIC PIXELBLAZE 

LED strip lengths
--------------------

Onion leds
4.77 meter - 143 pixels

Garlic leds
1.33 meter -  39 pixels


Here are some notes on the built in programs I like that I tred to tweak a bit.  They should be tweaked when its set up too, I'm not sure how bright things will need to be or how much dead space will look good.
--------------------

block reflection_slower 
- this is cool, its like breating in and out, sometimes the fades are too fast
	
	4 timers
	

color fade pulse_slower 
- nice gentle constant pulse, only half the strip is light at a time 
- might be nice to offset all 8 strip relative to eachother by 2PI/8
	
	3 timers
	t3 is the speed of the moving pulse


color twinkle bounce
- bounce is good, but its all a little fast - not sure how to slow it down easily
- 4 sections at a time
	
	2 timers


fast pulse_slower
- single pulse
- Pretty cool, but leaves a bit of dead time when it is off
- White dot in the center of the pulse might be too bright

	1 timer


millipese_slower
-cool fade foward and backward
-might move a litte too fast
	
	2 timers

	t1 controls the time of the fades, we loos the cool backwards wave affect when it gets too slow, but slower is probably better overall

	added a clamp to the v val to keep the brighess from getting too high, try tuning this so see what looks good.  Making it low will also have the affect of limiting the colors, but I think that is ok here


oppositeies   -  good slow fades
-mehhh


sparks
-too much noise, and too fast, but nice white sparks


sparcs center
-too much noise, and too fast, but nice white sparks


SlowRainbow
-Full strips light and slowly cycling through the full rainbow

	v is for changing the brightnes
	t is for changing the fade speec
